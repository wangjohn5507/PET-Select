Here are some examples of how to generate the code.

Example 1:

Here is your task: 
Anton has the integer x. He is interested what positive integer, which doesn't exceed x, has the maximum sum of digits.

Your task is to help Anton and to find the integer that interests him. If there are several such integers, determine the biggest of them. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the integer which Anton has. 


-----Output-----

Print the positive integer which doesn't exceed x and has the maximum sum of digits. If there are several such integers, print the biggest of them. Printed integer must not contain leading zeros.

```python
def solution(stdin: str) -> str:
    x = int(stdin.strip())
    
    # Function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
    def sum_of_digits(n):
        return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
    
    # Start with the number itself
    max_sum = sum_of_digits(x)
    result = x
    
    # Convert x to a string to manipulate digits
    x_str = str(x)
    n = len(x_str)
    
    # Try to form numbers by reducing some digit and making all following digits 9
    for i in range(n):
        if x_str[i] == '0':
            continue

Example 2:

Here is your task: 
You have a long fence which consists of $n$ sections. Unfortunately, it is not painted, so you decided to hire $q$ painters to paint it. $i$-th painter will paint all sections $x$ such that $l_i \\le x \\le r_i$.

Unfortunately, you are on a tight budget, so you may hire only $q - 2$ painters. Obviously, only painters you hire will do their work.

You want to maximize the number of painted sections if you choose $q - 2$ painters optimally. A section is considered painted if at least one painter paints it.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($3 \\le n, q \\le 5000$) — the number of sections and the number of painters availible for hire, respectively.

Then $q$ lines follow, each describing one of the painters: $i$-th line contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — maximum number of painted sections if you hire $q - 2$ painters.

```python
def solution(stdin: str) -> str:
    # Parse input
    lines = stdin.strip().split('\n')
    n, q = map(int, lines[0].split())
    painters = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines[1:]]
    
    # Initialize a list to count coverage of each section
    coverage = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Calculate the initial coverage with all painters
    for l, r in painters:
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            coverage[i] += 1
    
    # Calculate the total number of initially painted sections
    total_painted = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if coverage[i] > 0)
    
    # To find the optimal q-2 painters, we need to consider the effect of removing each pair of painters
    max_painted = 0
    
    # Iterate over all pairs of painters to remove
    for i in range(q):
        for j in range(i + 1, q):
            # Create a temporary coverage array to simulate removing painters i and j
            temp_coverage = coverage[:]
            
            # Remove the effect of painter i
            l1, r1 = painters[i]
            for k in range(l1, r1 + 1):
                temp_coverage[k] -= 1
            
            # Remove the effect of painter j
            l2, r2 = painters[j]
            for k in range(l2, r2 + 1):
                temp_coverage[k] -= 1
            
            # Calculate the number of painted sections with these two painters removed
            painted_with_removal = sum(1 for k in range(1, n + 1) if temp_coverage[k] > 0)
            
            # Update the maximum painted sections found
            max_painted = max(max_painted, painted_with_removal)
    
    return str(max_painted)
```

Example 3:

Here is your task: 
Jamie loves sleeping. One day, he decides that he needs to wake up at exactly hh: mm. However, he hates waking up, so he wants to make waking up less painful by setting the alarm at a lucky time. He will then press the snooze button every x minutes until hh: mm is reached, and only then he will wake up. He wants to know what is the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button.

A time is considered lucky if it contains a digit '7'. For example, 13: 07 and 17: 27 are lucky, while 00: 48 and 21: 34 are not lucky.

Note that it is not necessary that the time set for the alarm and the wake-up time are on the same day. It is guaranteed that there is a lucky time Jamie can set so that he can wake at hh: mm.

Formally, find the smallest possible non-negative integer y such that the time representation of the time x·y minutes before hh: mm contains the digit '7'.

Jamie uses 24-hours clock, so after 23: 59 comes 00: 00.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 60).

The second line contains two two-digit integers, hh and mm (00 ≤ hh ≤ 23, 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of times he needs to press the button.

```python
def solution(stdin: str) -> str:
    lines = stdin.strip().split('\n')
    x = int(lines[0])
    hh, mm = map(int, lines[1].split())

    def is_lucky(h, m):
        return '7' in f"h:02d m:02d"

    y = 0
    while not is_lucky(hh, mm):
        mm -= x
        if mm < 0:
            mm += 60
            hh -= 1
            if hh < 0:
                hh = 23
        y += 1

    return str(y)
