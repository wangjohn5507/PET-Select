Here are some examples of how to generate the code step by step.

Example 1:

Here is your task: 
Anton has the integer x. He is interested what positive integer, which doesn't exceed x, has the maximum sum of digits.

Your task is to help Anton and to find the integer that interests him. If there are several such integers, determine the biggest of them. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the integer which Anton has. 


-----Output-----

Print the positive integer which doesn't exceed x and has the maximum sum of digits. If there are several such integers, print the biggest of them. Printed integer must not contain leading zeros.

```python
def solution(stdin: str) -> str:
    # 1. Read and convert the input string to an integer x
    x = int(stdin.strip())
    
    # 2. Define a helper function to calculate the sum of digits of a number

    #    - result to x (this is our baseline result)
    max_sum = sum_of_digits(x)

    # 4. Convert x to a string to more easily manipulate individual digits

    # 5. Loop through each digit of x_str

        current_sum = sum_of_digits(new_number)
        
        # 8. If the new candidate has a larger digit sum, or ties the digit sum but is numerically larger,

Example 2:

Here is your task: 
You have a long fence which consists of $n$ sections. Unfortunately, it is not painted, so you decided to hire $q$ painters to paint it. $i$-th painter will paint all sections $x$ such that $l_i \\le x \\le r_i$.

Unfortunately, you are on a tight budget, so you may hire only $q - 2$ painters. Obviously, only painters you hire will do their work.

You want to maximize the number of painted sections if you choose $q - 2$ painters optimally. A section is considered painted if at least one painter paints it.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($3 \\le n, q \\le 5000$) — the number of sections and the number of painters availible for hire, respectively.

Then $q$ lines follow, each describing one of the painters: $i$-th line contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — maximum number of painted sections if you hire $q - 2$ painters.

```python
def solution(stdin: str) -> str:
    # 1. Parse the input
    lines = stdin.strip().split('\n')
    n, q = map(int, lines[0].split())         # n = number of fence sections, q = number of painters
    painters = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines[1:]]
    
    # 2. Initialize a coverage array
    #    This array (index 1 through n) will track how many painters paint each section.
    coverage = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # 3. Calculate the initial coverage for all painters
    for l, r in painters:
        for i in range(l, r + 1):

    #    (where coverage > 0 means the section is painted by at least one painter).
    total_painted = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if coverage[i] > 0)
    
    # 5. We want to remove exactly two painters to maximize the painted fence length 
    #    by the remaining (q-2) painters.
    max_painted = 0
    
    # 6. Iterate over all possible pairs of painters to remove

                temp_coverage[k] -= 1
            
            # 10. Calculate the number of sections still painted after removing these two painters
            painted_with_removal = sum(1 for k in range(1, n + 1) if temp_coverage[k] > 0)
            
            # 11. Update max_painted if we found a better (larger) painted count
            max_painted = max(max_painted, painted_with_removal)

Example 3:

Here is your task: 
Jamie loves sleeping. One day, he decides that he needs to wake up at exactly hh: mm. However, he hates waking up, so he wants to make waking up less painful by setting the alarm at a lucky time. He will then press the snooze button every x minutes until hh: mm is reached, and only then he will wake up. He wants to know what is the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button.

A time is considered lucky if it contains a digit '7'. For example, 13: 07 and 17: 27 are lucky, while 00: 48 and 21: 34 are not lucky.

Note that it is not necessary that the time set for the alarm and the wake-up time are on the same day. It is guaranteed that there is a lucky time Jamie can set so that he can wake at hh: mm.

Formally, find the smallest possible non-negative integer y such that the time representation of the time x·y minutes before hh: mm contains the digit '7'.

Jamie uses 24-hours clock, so after 23: 59 comes 00: 00.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 60).

The second line contains two two-digit integers, hh and mm (00 ≤ hh ≤ 23, 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of times he needs to press the button.

```python
def solution(stdin: str) -> str:
    # 1. Parse the input
    lines = stdin.strip().split('\n')
    x = int(lines[0])                # x is the number of minutes we move backwards each step
    hh, mm = map(int, lines[1].split())  # hh and mm are the current hour and minute

    # 2. Define a function to check if the current time is "lucky"
    def is_lucky(h, m):
        return '7' in f"h:02d m:02d"

    # 3. Initialize a counter for how many steps it takes to reach a lucky time
    y = 0

    # 4. Keep subtracting x minutes from the current time until we hit a "lucky" time
    while not is_lucky(hh, mm):
        # Subtract x minutes
        mm -= x

        # If the minutes go below zero, wrap around to the previous hour
        if mm < 0:
            mm += 60
            hh -= 1
            # If the hour goes below zero, wrap around to 23 (midnight boundary)
            if hh < 0:
                hh = 23

        # Increment the step counter
        y += 1

    # 5. Return how many steps (y) it took as a string
    return str(y)
