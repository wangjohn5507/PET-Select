Well, or like multiple arithmetic progressions.\n\nPolycarpus believes that if he writes out the population of the capital for several consecutive years in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, then it is convenient to consider the array as several arithmetic progressions, written one after the other. For example, sequence (8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 4, 7, 10, 2) can be considered as a sequence of three arithmetic progressions (8, 6, 4, 2), (1, 4, 7, 10) and (2), which are written one after another.\n\nUnfortunately, Polycarpus may not have all the data for the n consecutive years (a census of the population doesn't occur every year, after all).

Let's call a number d-magic if digit d appears in decimal presentation of the number on even positions and nowhere else.\n\nFor example, the numbers 1727374, 17, 1 are 7-magic but 77, 7, 123, 34, 71 are not 7-magic.
